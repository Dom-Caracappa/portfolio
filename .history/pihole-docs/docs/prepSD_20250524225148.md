# Prepare the SD Card (Headless Setup)

Our Pi is headless by design. That means no monitor, no mouse, no bloat — just pure utility. We manage everything over SSH, which keeps things lightweight, secure, and easy to automate. If something breaks, we can rebuild it fast — no clicks required.

This page explains how to flash and configure the SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager, with headless options pre-configured.

## Insert and Boot

After writing is complete:

1. Eject the SD card from your computer.
2. Insert it into the Raspberry Pi.
3. Plug in the power — no monitor or keyboard needed.

The Pi will boot, connect to your network, and be ready for SSH access.
