# Prepare the SD Card (Headless Setup)

Our Pi is headless by design. That means no monitor, no mouse, no bloat — just pure utility. We manage everything over SSH, which keeps things lightweight, secure, and easy to automate. If something breaks, we can rebuild it fast — no clicks required.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model with Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
- A microSD card (16GB or larger)
- A microSD card reader
- Raspberry Pi Imager installed (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" target="_blank">Download here</a>)
- Your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password (if not using Ethernet)

## Configure and Flash the OS

### Step 1: Open Raspberry Pi Imager

Launch the application on your computer.

### Step 2: Select the Device

We are using a Raspberry Pi 4 in this tutorial. However, Pi-hole can easily run on even the relatively underpowered <strong>Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</strong>.

### Step 3: Select the Operating System

Choose <strong>Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)</strong> — this version does not include a graphical desktop, which is ideal for headless setups.

Follow the steps below to navigate the Raspberry Pi Imager menus:

### Step 4: Select the SD Card

Choose your target SD card carefully and confirm it’s the correct one before proceeding.

### Step 5: Open Advanced Settings

Click the gear icon to configure:

- Enable SSH
- Set hostname (e.g. <code>ourpi.local</code>)
- Enter Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, password, region)
- Set a username and password
- Choose your locale and timezone

### Step 6: Write the Image

Click <strong>Save</strong>, then <strong>Write</strong> to begin flashing the SD card.

## Insert and Boot

Once the SD card is flashed:

1. Safely eject it from your computer
2. Insert it into your Raspberry Pi
3. Power it on — no screen or keyboard required

Your Pi will boot, connect to the network, and SSH will be available.
