# Prepare the SD Card (Headless Setup)

Our Pi is headless by design. That means no monitor, no mouse, no bloat — just pure utility. We manage everything over SSH, which keeps things lightweight, secure, and easy to automate. If something breaks, we can rebuild it fast — no clicks required.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model with Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
- A microSD card (16GB or larger)
- A microSD card reader
- Raspberry Pi Imager installed ([Download here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/))
- Your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password (if not using Ethernet)

---

## Configure and Flash the OS

### Step 1: Open Raspberry Pi Imager

Launch the application on your computer.

### Step 2: Select the Device

We are using a Raspberry Pi 4 in this tutorial, however PiHole can easily run on even the relatively underpowered **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**

### Step 4: Select the SD Card

Choose your target SD card carefully and confirm it’s the correct one before proceeding.

### Step 5: Open Advanced Settings

Click the gear icon to configure:

- Enable SSH
- Set hostname (e.g. `ourpi.local`)
- Enter Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, password, region)
- Set a username and password
- Choose your locale and timezone

### Step 6: Write the Image

Click **Save**, then **Write** to begin flashing the SD card.

## Insert and Boot

Once the SD card is flashed:

1. Safely eject it from your computer
2. Insert it into your Raspberry Pi
3. Power it on — no screen or keyboard required

Your Pi will boot, connect to the network, and SSH will be available.
