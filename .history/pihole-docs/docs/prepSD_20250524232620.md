# Headless Setup: Installing Raspberry Pi OS and Preparing for Pi-hole

This section covers how to prepare your Raspberry Pi for a headless installation of Pi-hole by flashing Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto a microSD card and configuring it with SSH and network credentials — all without connecting a monitor or keyboard.

We’ll use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool and take advantage of its advanced setup features to get you on the network quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Raspberry Pi (any model with Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
- A microSD card (16GB or larger)
- A microSD card reader
- Raspberry Pi Imager installed ([Download here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/))
- Your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password (if not using Ethernet)

## Insert and Boot

1. Eject the SD card from your computer.
2. Insert it into the Raspberry Pi.
3. Connect power and (optionally) Ethernet.
4. Wait 60–90 seconds for the Pi to fully boot.

## Find Your Pi on the Network

There are two ways to find your Pi:

### Option 1: Via Your Router

Log into your router's admin panel and look for a device with the hostname you set (e.g., `ourpi.local` or similar).

### Option 2: Use `nmap` (Network Scan)

From another computer on the same network:

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

Look for a Raspberry Pi in the results. Note its IP address.

---

## SSH Into the Pi

Use the IP you found to connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh yourusername@<IP_ADDRESS>
```

Example:

```bash
ssh dom@192.168.1.105
```

If successful, you’ll land in the Raspberry Pi terminal.

---

## System Update (First Boot)

Once logged in, run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Optionally run `sudo raspi-config` to:
- Change hostname
- Set locale, time zone, or keyboard layout
- Enable interfaces (e.g., I2C, SPI, etc.)

## What’s Next?

Once the Pi is online and updated, you're ready to install Pi-hole.
