# Docs-as-Code Starter Kit

_A modular, version-controlled documentation system — built for clarity, automation, and modern developer collaboration._

---

## Tools Used

- **MkDocs + Material** – static site generator + beautiful responsive theme  
- **Markdown** – simple, modular content authoring  
- **GitHub Actions** – automatic CI/CD on push  
- **GitHub Pages** – zero-cost hosting  

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dom-Caracappa/docs-as-code-starter.git
cd docs-as-code-starter
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

## Why Docs-as-Code?

By treating documentation as source code, teams can:

    Collaborate like developers

    Automate builds and previews

    Track version history and authorship

    Enforce review and quality gates

    Integrate docs into deployment pipelines

This kit shows how documentation can evolve with the same rigor and tooling as modern software — and how technical writers can lead that transformation.

## About This Project

This starter kit was created by Dominick Caracappa as part of a technical writing portfolio to demonstrate Docs-as-Code workflows using:

    MkDocs + Material for structure and theming

    GitHub Actions for continuous integration

    GitHub Pages for live deployment

This project shows how documentation can be versioned, reviewed, and deployed just like code — making it easier for teams to scale quality technical content.
