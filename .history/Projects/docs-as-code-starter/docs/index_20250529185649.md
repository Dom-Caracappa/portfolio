## Why Docs-as-Code?

By treating documentation as source code, teams can:

    Collaborate like developers

    Automate builds and previews

    Track version history and authorship

    Enforce review and quality gates

    Integrate docs into deployment pipelines

This kit shows how documentation can evolve with the same rigor and tooling as modern software — and how technical writers can lead that transformation.

## 👋 About This Project

This starter kit was created by **Dom Caracappa** as part of a technical writing portfolio to demonstrate Docs-as-Code workflows using:

- MkDocs + Material for structure and theming
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- GitHub Pages for live deployment

This project shows how documentation can be versioned, reviewed, and deployed just like code — making it easier for teams to scale quality technical content.
