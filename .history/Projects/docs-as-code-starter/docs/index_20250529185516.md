## 👋 About This Project

This starter kit was created by **Dom Caracappa** as part of a technical writing portfolio to demonstrate Docs-as-Code workflows using:

- MkDocs + Material for structure and theming
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- GitHub Pages for live deployment

This project shows how documentation can be versioned, reviewed, and deployed just like code — making it easier for teams to scale quality technical content.
