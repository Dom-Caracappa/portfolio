# Deployment

There are two ways to deploy your MkDocs site.

---

## Local Preview

Before deploying, always preview your site locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

➡️ Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the live preview.

---

## Manual Deployment

Use this command to build and deploy manually:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

This will:
- Build your site into the `site/` directory
- Force-push the contents to the `gh-pages` branch
- Make it live on GitHub Pages

---

## Automated Deployment

If you've configured [CI/CD with GitHub Actions](ci-cd.md), just push to `main`:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update docs"
git push
```

Your GitHub Actions workflow will:
- Install dependencies
- Build the site
- Push to `gh-pages` automatically

---

## Clean Builds (Optional)

To clean the build before redeploying:

```bash
mkdocs build --clean
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

---

## Screenshots (Optional)

Include screenshots of:
- GitHub Actions output
- `gh-pages` branch contents
- Live site view

Use this format:

```markdown

```
