# CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate the deployment of your MkDocs documentation.

---

## Workflow File

A workflow file is included at:

```text
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

This file defines a pipeline that:

- Runs on every push to the `main` branch
- Installs Python and MkDocs in the GitHub-hosted runner
- Builds the documentation
- Deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch using `mkdocs gh-deploy`

---

## Sample Workflow

Here's a simplified version of the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: 3.10

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

---

## Authentication

To allow `gh-deploy` to push to the `gh-pages` branch, GitHub automatically provides a token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`) in your workflow environment.

No extra setup is required unless you're publishing to a custom repo or organization with restricted permissions.
