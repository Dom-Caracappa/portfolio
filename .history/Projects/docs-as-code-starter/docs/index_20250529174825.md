# Docs-as-Code Starter Kit

Welcome to the Docs-as-Code Starter Kit â€” a lightweight example of how to write, structure, and deploy modern documentation using Markdown and open source tooling.

---

## What This Is

This is a documentation system powered by:

- **MkDocs**: A static site generator geared toward documentation
- **Material for MkDocs**: A professional, responsive theme
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting

This kit is meant to show how technical writers can version control, modularize, preview, and publish docs just like software engineers.
