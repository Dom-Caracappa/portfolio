    cd docs-as-code-starter
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash

    ```

4. **Start the local development server:**

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

➡️ Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view the site locally.
